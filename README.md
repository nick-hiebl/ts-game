## Getting started

You will need TypeScript for this.

```
npm install -g typescript
```

To run and test locally you will need a local dev server of some kind. To run one built in to Python try:
```
python3 -m http.server 80
```
Alternatively install a simple Node one with:
```
npm install -g http-server
```
and run it with:
```
http-server
```

## Dev-loop

Change code and run
```
tsc
```
to recompile.
